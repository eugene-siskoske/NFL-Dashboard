# NFL-Dashboard

Using data from 2001 - 2023, I took a look at NFL's passing statistics over the years to see if any underlying trends can be seen. I made a dashboard to display the most common data I was using for this research.

This data was compiled using MySQL and the dashboard was created in Tableau. You can view the full Tableau Dashboard by clicking here.
